# Predicting Corporate Training Program Effectiveness using Machine Learning

This repository contains the complete code, data, and resources for my Master's thesis at HSE University in the Master of Data Science program.  
The thesis explores the use of machine learning models to predict and optimize the effectiveness of corporate training programs based on employee profiles, training history, and engagement data.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Organizations invest heavily in training, yet evaluating training effectiveness remains a challenge.  
This project uses logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost to predict training success based on various HR datasets.  
Insights gained from the models can help HR departments make data-driven decisions on training planning and evaluation.
